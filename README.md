# prelude

To complete
[HVM](https://github.com/Kindelia/HVM)
development, we need to decide which purely functional data structures are going to be used on Kindelia
to handle access information on memory.

The image below represents partially what we are interested in:

To decide which methods work better, we need to implement different algorithms and data structures and compare the number of "rewrites" and "memory" wasted.

A great source of functional algorithms with examples is the
[Okasaki Book](https://br1lib.org/book/502927/5b4598)
([other links](https://br1lib.org/s/PRUTELY%20FUNCTIONAL%20DATA%20STRUCTURES%20OSAKI)), and
[this list of links](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/whats-new-in-purely-functional-data-structures-since-okasaki).

There is a
[video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECstIu4I3NM) (in portuguese),
made a Kindelia team member, explaining how to implement the patricia tree,
based on this
[paper](https://ittc.ku.edu/~andygill/papers/IntMap98.pdf).

There isn't a language since it's been built from zero, and it's not necessary on functional programing.

Anyway, there is the [HVM's Core Language Overview](https://github.com/Kindelia/HVM/blob/master/HOW.md#hvms-core-language-overview),
and there are  some functions which are been used repeatedly,
maybe you can find more about then on
[kind repository](https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind/tree/master/base).
